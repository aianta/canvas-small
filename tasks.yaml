      :Text: Psychology, as a scientific discipline, is grounded in empirical research
        and the systematic study of behavior and mental processes. It relies on rigorous
        methodologies, peer-reviewed evidence, and ethical standards to understand
        the complexities of the human mind. In contrast, pseudoscience often masquerades
        as legitimate science but lacks the foundational principles of scientific
        inquiry—such as falsifiability, reproducibility, and critical peer evaluation.
        Practices like astrology, phrenology, or certain fringe self-help techniques
        may claim psychological benefits but typically rely on anecdotal evidence,
        confirmation bias, or misleading jargon. Distinguishing between psychology
        and pseudoscience is vital—not just for academic integrity, but for protecting
        individuals from potentially harmful or exploitative practices disguised as
        therapeutic truth.
